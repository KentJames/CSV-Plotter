This is a very simple CSV Plotter written in python 3. It will plot CSV's in three ways:

- A single CSV file.
- A whole directory of CSV files. Same columns for all. Not recursive.
- Plot multiple CSV files into the same plot. Same columns for all.


You need matplotlib to run this. Apart from that, vanilla python is all that is needed.

To get instructions run: python3 generateplots.py --help
